# 🌿 PlantSync: Plant Disease Detection Mobile Application

PlantSync is a full-stack AI-integrated mobile application that helps users diagnose plant diseases simply by uploading an image of a plant leaf. Powered by Flutter for the frontend, Django for the backend, and a TensorFlow deep learning model, it predicts whether the plant is healthy or affected by a disease.
